# PROCESS GitHub Check - Repository Health & Alignment Verification
*Step-by-Step GitHub Repository Maintenance Procedures*
*Updated: September 7, 2025*

## üìã **GITHUB HEALTH CHECK WORKFLOW**

### **STEP 1: Repository State Assessment**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST check repository integrity:**
   - Git history consistency and completeness
   - Branch structure and alignment (main, development branches)
   - Remote vs local synchronization status
   - Repository size and performance metrics
2. **REQUIRED: MUST verify content alignment:**
   - Local project state vs GitHub repository contents
   - Missing or extra files in repository
   - .gitignore effectiveness (no unwanted files tracked)
   - Large file identification and LFS usage assessment
3. **REQUIRED: MUST review repository metadata:**
   - Repository description accuracy
   - Topic tags relevance and completeness
   - README.md visibility and current status
   - License file presence and accuracy

### **STEP 2: Commit & Branch Health Analysis**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST analyze commit history quality:**
   - Commit message clarity and conventions
   - Commit size appropriateness (atomic changes)
   - Author information consistency
   - Frequency and timing patterns
2. **REQUIRED: MUST review branch management:**
   - Active branch count and purpose
   - Stale branch identification
   - Merge conflict resolution status
   - Protected branch settings verification
3. **REQUIRED: MUST analyze repository activity:**
   - Recent activity patterns
   - Collaboration patterns (if applicable)
   - Issue tracking alignment with development
   - Pull request status and quality

### **STEP 3: Security & Access Review**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST review security posture:**
   - SSH key functionality and security
   - Access permissions appropriateness
   - Secret scanning results
   - Vulnerability alerts status
2. **REQUIRED: MUST review repository settings:**
   - Visibility settings alignment with project needs
   - Collaboration settings (if applicable)
   - Security features enabled (dependabot, etc.)
   - Backup and disaster recovery considerations

### **STEP 4: Alignment Verification**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST verify project-repository alignment:**
   - Local development state vs repository state
   - Version numbers and tagging consistency
   - Documentation accuracy in repository
   - Deployment readiness verification
2. **REQUIRED: MUST verify development workflow alignment:**
   - WOW process adherence in repository practices
   - Consistent development patterns
   - Integration with development tools
   - Automated workflow functionality (if applicable)

### **STEP 5: Repository Optimization**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST perform performance optimization:**
   - Repository size optimization
   - Large file management
   - Git garbage collection if needed
   - Archive old branches if appropriate
2. **REQUIRED: MUST make organization improvements:**
   - File structure optimization
   - Documentation organization
   - Tag and release management
   - Repository description and metadata updates
