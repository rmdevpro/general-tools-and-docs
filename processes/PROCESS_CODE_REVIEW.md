# PROCESS Code Review - Code Quality Analysis & Optimization
*Step-by-Step Code Maintenance Procedures*
*Updated: September 7, 2025*

## ‚ö° **CODE REVIEW WORKFLOW**

### **STEP 1: Code Discovery & Inventory**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST scan code directories:**
   - working/ directory (development code)
   - UPLOAD_TO_HF/ and CLEAN_DEPLOY_HF/ (production code)
   - Archived code directories
   - Configuration files (Dockerfile, requirements.txt)
2. **REQUIRED: MUST classify code files:**
   - Active vs deprecated code
   - Development vs production versions
   - Core functionality vs utilities
   - Test files and examples
3. **REQUIRED: MUST analyze codebase structure:**
   - File organization and naming
   - Import/dependency relationships
   - Function and class organization
   - Configuration management

### **STEP 2: Code Quality Assessment**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST perform functionality review:**
   - Code correctness and logic
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Performance characteristics
   - Resource usage efficiency
2. **REQUIRED: MUST perform maintainability analysis:**
   - Code readability and clarity
   - Comment quality and coverage
   - Function/class size and complexity
   - Naming conventions consistency
3. **REQUIRED: MUST perform security evaluation:**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secret management practices
   - Error message information leakage
   - Dependency security considerations
4. **REQUIRED: MUST check architecture compliance:**
   - HAWKMOTH integration patterns
   - API design consistency
   - Configuration management
   - Logging and monitoring

### **STEP 3: Code Classification**
**Categories for each code file:**
- **üü¢ EXCELLENT** - Clean, efficient, well-documented
- **üü° GOOD** - Minor improvements needed
- **üü† FAIR** - Significant refactoring required
- **üî¥ POOR** - Major issues, needs rewrite
- **‚ö´ OBSOLETE** - No longer used, candidate for removal

### **STEP 4: Code Improvement Actions**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST handle excellent/Good code:**
   - Add missing docstrings/comments
   - Minor performance optimizations
   - Consistent formatting application
2. **REQUIRED: MUST handle fair code:**
   - Function/class restructuring
   - Error handling improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Documentation additions
3. **REQUIRED: MUST handle poor code:**
   - Complete refactoring or rewrite
   - Architecture pattern implementation
   - Security vulnerability fixes
   - Comprehensive testing addition
4. **REQUIRED: MUST handle obsolete code:**
   - Archive with clear labeling
   - Remove from active directories
   - Update references in documentation

### **STEP 5: Code Standards Enforcement**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST enforce style consistency:**
   - PEP 8 compliance for Python
   - Consistent indentation and formatting
   - Import organization
   - Variable naming conventions
2. **REQUIRED: MUST enforce documentation standards:**
   - Function/class docstrings
   - Inline comments for complex logic
   - API documentation completeness
   - README updates for code changes
3. **REQUIRED: MUST enforce testing standards:**
   - Unit test coverage
   - Integration test completeness
   - Error condition testing
   - Performance benchmarking
