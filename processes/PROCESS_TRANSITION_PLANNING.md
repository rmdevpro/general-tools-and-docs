# PROCESS Transition Planning - Planning Session Handoff Procedures
*Ultra-Concise Bullet Point Steps*

## üèóÔ∏è **PLANNING TRANSITION STEPS**

### **Files to Update:**
- **G:/projects/General Tools and Docs/processes/SESSION_SUMMARY_PLANNING.md** - **REQUIRED: MUST update** planning-specific progress and findings
- **docs/roadmap/README.md** - **REQUIRED: MUST update** timeline for major milestone changes
- **docs/architecture/adr/** - **REQUIRED: MUST create/update** ADR for major decisions
- **docs/components/README.md** - **REQUIRED: MUST update** for new components planned

### **Git Operations (Conditional):**
- **REQUIRED: MUST assess changes:** Check if git-relevant changes were made during session
- **Git-relevant changes include:**
  - Architecture decisions documented in docs/architecture/adr/
  - Component documentation updates in docs/components/
  - Roadmap updates with concrete timeline changes
  - Major planning decisions affecting implementation
- **If meaningful changes made:**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST see** G:/projects/General Tools and Docs/processes/PROCESS_GIT_OPERATIONS.md for detailed git commands
  - **REQUIRED: MUST use commit message:** "Planning: [brief description]"
  - **REQUIRED: MUST push changes** to sync
- **If only summary updates:**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST skip git operations**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST inform user:** "No git commit needed - only session summary updated"

### **Handoff Process:**
1. **MUST ask user:** "What type of session should we transition to?"
   ```
   1. **PLANNING** - Architecture & Design Focus
   2. **CODING** - Implementation & Development Focus  
   3. **TESTING** - Deployment & Validation Focus
   4. **MAINTENANCE** - System & Documentation Maintenance Focus
   ```
2. **MUST generate specific handoff header based on user's choice:**
