# PROCESS Vulnerability Check - Security & Obsolescence Assessment
*Step-by-Step Security and Dependency Review Procedures*
*Updated: September 7, 2025*

## 🔒 **VULNERABILITY CHECK WORKFLOW**

### **STEP 1: Security Surface Analysis**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST perform code security review:**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Secret management practices
   - Error handling and information disclosure
2. **REQUIRED: MUST create dependency inventory:**
   - Python packages (requirements.txt)
   - Docker base images
   - External service dependencies
   - Development tool dependencies
3. **REQUIRED: MUST analyze configuration security:**
   - Environment variable handling
   - API key management
   - Database connection security
   - Network security configurations

### **STEP 2: Vulnerability Scanning**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST perform dependency vulnerability check:**
   ```bash
   # Python package vulnerability scanning
   pip-audit --format=json
   safety check --json
   ```
2. **REQUIRED: MUST perform Docker image scanning:**
   ```bash
   # Docker vulnerability scanning
   docker scout quickview [image-name]
   docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     aquasec/trivy image [image-name]
   ```
3. **REQUIRED: MUST perform code static analysis:**
   ```bash
   # Security-focused code analysis
   bandit -r . -f json
   semgrep --config=auto --json
   ```

### **STEP 3: Dependency Obsolescence Check**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST perform package version analysis:**
   - Current vs latest available versions
   - Security patch availability
   - End-of-life status for dependencies
   - Breaking change assessment
2. **REQUIRED: MUST verify compatibility:**
   - Python version compatibility
   - Inter-package dependency conflicts
   - Platform compatibility
   - Performance impact of updates
3. **REQUIRED: MUST prioritize updates:**
   - Critical security updates
   - Important feature updates
   - Nice-to-have improvements
   - Breaking change considerations

### **STEP 4: Risk Classification**
**Categories for each vulnerability/obsolescence:**
- **🔴 CRITICAL** - Immediate security risk, must fix
- **🟠 HIGH** - Significant risk, fix soon
- **🟡 MEDIUM** - Moderate risk, plan fix
- **🟢 LOW** - Minor risk, fix when convenient
- **⚪ INFO** - No risk, informational only

### **STEP 5: Remediation & Updates**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST handle critical/High vulnerabilities:**
   - Immediate patching or workarounds
   - Dependency updates or replacements
   - Configuration security hardening
   - Emergency deployment if needed
2. **REQUIRED: MUST handle medium vulnerabilities:**
   - Planned remediation in next development cycle
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
3. **REQUIRED: MUST handle low/Info items:**
   - Documentation of known issues
   - Inclusion in future maintenance cycles
   - Monitoring for status changes
