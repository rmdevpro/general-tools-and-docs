# PROCESS Transition Coding - Coding Session Handoff Procedures
*Ultra-Concise Bullet Point Steps*

## ‚ö° **CODING TRANSITION STEPS**

### **Files to Update:**
- **G:/projects/General Tools and Docs/processes/SESSION_SUMMARY_CODING.md** - **REQUIRED: MUST update** coding-specific progress and technical status
- **version.json** - **REQUIRED: MUST increment** for milestone completion
- **working/[COMPONENT]_SUMMARY.md** - **REQUIRED: MUST create** for major changes
- **UPLOAD_TO_HF/** - **REQUIRED: MUST update** production files when components are tested

### **Git Operations (Conditional):**
- **REQUIRED: MUST assess changes:** Check if git-relevant changes were made during session
- **Git-relevant changes include:**
  - Code changes in working/, UPLOAD_TO_HF/, or production files
  - Version increments in version.json
  - Component implementation or major feature additions
  - Production-ready code or deployment packages
- **If meaningful changes made:**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST see** G:/projects/General Tools and Docs/processes/PROCESS_GIT_OPERATIONS.md for detailed git commands
  - **REQUIRED: MUST use commit message:** "Coding: [feature] - [description]"
  - **REQUIRED: MUST tag release** for version milestones (v0.0.5, v0.1.0, etc.)
  - **REQUIRED: MUST push changes** to sync
- **If only summary updates:**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST skip git operations**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST inform user:** "No git commit needed - only session summary updated"

### **Handoff Process:**
1. **MUST ask user:** "What type of session should we transition to?"
   ```
   1. **PLANNING** - Architecture & Design Focus
   2. **CODING** - Implementation & Development Focus  
   3. **TESTING** - Deployment & Validation Focus
   4. **MAINTENANCE** - System & Documentation Maintenance Focus
   ```
2. **REQUIRED: MUST provide handoff message in copyable code block format** based on user's choice:
3. **REQUIRED: NEVER provide handoff message as regular text** - always use code block with copy button
