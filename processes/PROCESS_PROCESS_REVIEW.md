# PROCESS Process Review - WOW System Maintenance & Alignment
*Step-by-Step Process Maintenance Procedures*
*Updated: September 7, 2025*

## 🔄 **PROCESS REVIEW WORKFLOW**

### **STEP 1: Process File Discovery & Inventory**
1. **REQUIRED: MUST scan process directories:**
   - G:/projects/ways_of_working/ (all WOW and PROCESS files)
   - Cross-references to external processes
   - Archived process files for comparison
2. **REQUIRED: MUST map process relationships:**
   - WOW → PROCESS file references
   - Process → Process dependencies
   - Circular references or conflicts
   - Missing process links
3. **REQUIRED: MUST analyze process coverage:**
   - Complete workflow coverage
   - Gap identification
   - Redundancy detection
   - Process hierarchy validation

### **STEP 2: Process Effectiveness Assessment**
1. **Usability evaluation:**
   - Clear step-by-step instructions
   - Appropriate level of detail
   - Actionable vs theoretical content
   - Easy navigation and reference
2. **Alignment check:**
   - WOW principles vs PROCESS implementation
   - Consistency across related processes
   - Current workflow vs documented process
   - Tool/technology alignment
3. **Completeness analysis:**
   - All necessary steps included
   - Prerequisites clearly stated
   - Expected outcomes defined
   - Error handling procedures

### **STEP 3: Process Classification**
**Categories for each process:**
- **🟢 EXCELLENT** - Clear, complete, well-aligned
- **🟡 GOOD** - Minor alignment issues
- **🟠 FAIR** - Significant gaps or misalignment
- **🔴 POOR** - Major issues, needs redesign
- **⚫ OBSOLETE** - No longer relevant to current workflow

### **STEP 4: Process Improvement Actions**
1. **Excellent/Good processes:**
   - Minor clarifications and updates
   - Add missing cross-references
   - Update file paths and references
2. **Fair processes:**
   - Restructure for better clarity
   - Fill in missing steps or details
   - Improve alignment with WOW principles
   - Add practical examples
3. **Poor processes:**
   - Complete redesign or consolidation
   - Break complex processes into smaller parts
   - Align with current best practices
   - Add comprehensive validation steps
4. **Obsolete processes:**
   - Archive with .archived extension
   - Update references to current alternatives
   - Document deprecation rationale

### **STEP 5: Process System Optimization**
1. **Reference optimization:**
   - Ensure all file paths are complete and accurate
   - Validate cross-references work correctly
   - Remove broken or outdated links
   - Standardize reference formats
2. **Workflow efficiency:**
   - Eliminate redundant steps
   - Streamline complex procedures
   - Improve process interconnections
   - Reduce cognitive load
3. **Documentation standards:**
   - Consistent formatting across all processes
   - Standard section headings
   - Uniform terminology usage
   - Clear action vs reference distinction

## 🔍 **PROCESS REVIEW CHECKLIST**

### **For Each WOW File:**
- [ ] Clear directional principles stated
- [ ] Appropriate process file references
- [ ] Consistent with other WOW files
- [ ] Complete coverage of session type
- [ ] Proper transition triggers

### **For Each PROCESS File:**
- [ ] Step-by-step procedures clear
- [ ] All prerequisites stated
- [ ] Expected outcomes defined
- [ ] Error handling included
- [ ] Proper cross-references

### **For Process System:**
- [ ] Complete workflow coverage
- [ ] No process gaps or conflicts
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Proper file path references
- [ ] Clear separation of WOW vs PROCESS

## 🔧 **PROCESS ALIGNMENT VERIFICATION**

### **WOW ↔ PROCESS Alignment:**
1. **Check each WOW file references correct PROCESS files**
2. **Verify PROCESS files implement WOW principles**
3. **Ensure no missing process implementations**
4. **Validate process file completeness**

### **Cross-Process Dependencies:**
1. **Map all process interconnections**
2. **Check for circular dependencies**
3. **Verify shared resource access**
4. **Validate transition procedures**

### **Tool Integration:**
1. **File system access patterns**
2. **Git operation consistency**
3. **Deployment process alignment**
4. **External tool references**
