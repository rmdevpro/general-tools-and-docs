# PROCESS Transition Maintenance - Maintenance Session Handoff Procedures
*Ultra-Concise Bullet Point Steps*

## üîß **MAINTENANCE TRANSITION STEPS**

### **Files to Update:**
- **G:/projects/General Tools and Docs/processes/SESSION_SUMMARY_MAINTENANCE.md** - **REQUIRED: MUST update** maintenance-specific findings and system health status
- **version.json** - **REQUIRED: MUST update** for any version changes from maintenance
- **working/maintenance_report.md** - **REQUIRED: MUST create** comprehensive maintenance findings report
- **docs/maintenance/** - **REQUIRED: MUST archive** detailed maintenance reports and metrics

### **Maintenance Documentation:**
- **Document review results** - **REQUIRED: MUST document** file cleanup and improvement tracking
- **Code review findings** - **REQUIRED: MUST document** technical debt and improvement recommendations
- **Process review outcomes** - **REQUIRED: MUST document** session framework optimization results
- **Health check reports** - **REQUIRED: MUST document** system performance and availability metrics
- **Vulnerability assessments** - **REQUIRED: MUST document** security findings and remediation status
- **Cost optimization results** - **REQUIRED: MUST document** spending analysis and savings achieved

### **Git Operations (Conditional):**
- **REQUIRED: MUST assess changes:** Check if git-relevant changes were made during session
- **Git-relevant changes include:**
  - Security fixes or vulnerability remediation
  - Performance improvements affecting code
  - Documentation restructuring or major updates
  - Process improvements affecting workflow files
  - System configuration changes
- **If meaningful changes made:**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST see** G:/projects/General Tools and Docs/processes/PROCESS_GIT_OPERATIONS.md for detailed git commands
  - **REQUIRED: MUST use commit message:** "Maintenance: [maintenance type] - [summary of findings/actions]"
  - **REQUIRED: MUST tag** significant improvements: `v[version]-maintenance` for major optimizations
  - **REQUIRED: MUST push changes** to sync
- **If only summary updates:**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST skip git operations**
  - **REQUIRED: MUST inform user:** "No git commit needed - only session summary updated"

### **Handoff Process:**
1. **MUST ask user:** "What type of session should we transition to?"
   ```
   1. **PLANNING** - Architecture & Design Focus
   2. **CODING** - Implementation & Development Focus  
   3. **TESTING** - Deployment & Validation Focus
   4. **MAINTENANCE** - System & Documentation Maintenance Focus
   ```
2. **REQUIRED: MUST provide handoff message in copyable code block format** based on user's choice:
3. **REQUIRED: NEVER provide handoff message as regular text** - always use code block with copy button
